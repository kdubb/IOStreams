# ðŸš° IOStreams

## An asynchronous Swift I/O library

IOStreams is an asynchronous I/O library designed to make it easy to read & write your data taking full advantage of
Swift's powerful concurrency features. It uses a simple `Source` and `Sink` model that makes it easy to implement for
almost any data source or destination.

IOStreams comes with a number of standard sources and sinks, like files and memory, that fully support the async/await
concurrency model of Swift. Additionaly, IOStreams has been integrated with many Apple frameworks to provide buffering,
compression, encryption, hashing, etc.

## Getting Started

Using IOStreams is easy and allows you to consume high performance frameworks, like `DispatchIO`, using Swift
concurrency.

For example, to process large files using `DispatchIO` you only need to create a `FileSource` and `FileSource` and
asynchronously iterate buffers of file data.

```swift
func processFile(from sourceURL: URL, to sinkURL: URL) async {
  let sink = FileSink(url: sinkURL)
  let source = FileSource(url: sourceURL)
  
  for try await data in source.buffers() {
      
      let processedData = // process data
      
      try await sink.write(data: processedData);
  }
  
  try await source.close()
  try await sink.close()
```

If you are reading or writing small amounts of data at a time, buffering the streams can provide a big performance
boost, and with IOSStreams it's easy.

```swift
  let source = FileSource(url: sourceURL).buffered()
```

Additionally, IOStreams is integrated with a number of Apple frameworks to provide transparent data processing like
compression.

To compress the file from the previous example you only need to change one line

```swift
  let sink = FileSink(url: sinkURL).compress(algorithm: .lz4)
```

IOStreams provides integration for compression, encryption, and hashing out of the box.  

## Extending IOStreams

### `Source` and `Sink`

The library is built around primitive stream protocols, `Source` for input  and `Sink` for output. While the protocols 
are easy to implement, their methods are marked as `async` to allow implementors to use Swift concurrency in their
implmentations.

`Source` and `Sink` have been implemented for the two most common data sources, files and memory. 
`FileSource`/`FileSink` and `DataSource`/`DataSink` will handle most of your needs. If they don't, implementing them
is usually very easy. 

### `FilterSource` and `FilterSink`

Transforming data as it is read or written makes IOStreams a powerful data processing library. All of IOStreams' data
transformation capabilities are implemented via `FilterSource` and `FilterSink`; this includes the built-in compression
& encryption integrations.

#### `Filter`

Building your own data transformations are easy and do not require implementing your own `Source` and `Sink`.
Implementing the `Filter` interface and initializing instances of `FilterSource` and/or `FilterSink` is usually all you
will need to do.
